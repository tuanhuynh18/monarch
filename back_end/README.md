# Intro
The API is running on Heroku at https://yata-monarch.herokuapp.com. 

*Note*: Because the app runs on Heroku, the API server will go to sleep if no one is using it. This means when you make a 
request for the first time in a while, the first request may take a long time. This delay is normal and is simply the API 
server waking up. All requests after the first should be much faster.

# Admin Dashboard
A simple admin dashboard is available at [/admin][admin] that provides a tabular way to examine the data for each
object class. A valid user account is needed to access the admin dashboard, but a real email is not needed to sign up.

# API Documentation
When submitting form data to the API, set the `Content-Type` and `Accepts` HTTP headers to `application/json`. Any form
data sent to the server (e.g. via `POST` actions) should have a JSON body encoded as `raw json`, `form-data`, or
`x-www-form-urlencoded`.

## Querying the API via Postman
[Postman][postman_download] is an app to query APIs. Open the [Monarch Postman Collection][postman_collection] and 
the [Monarch Postman Environment File][postman_environment] in the `back_end` folder in Postman to query and check the 
API on your computer.

Refer to the [schema.rb][schema] file for a complete
look at the objects and properties available. Most fields shown will be sent in JSON responses, some are internal
fields.

## Sample Data
The API sets up [seed data][seeds] to generate some fake sample data. Most of this data will look weird and random 
because it has been randomly generated. Refrain from deleting too much sample data.  

## Authentication
Authenication is handled by user session cookies generated by the Ruby on Rails server. After signing in, a 
`_back_end_session` cookie will be returned. This cookie must be sent in subsequent request headers to authenticate the 
user.
